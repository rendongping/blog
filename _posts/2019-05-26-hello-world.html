                    Once upon a time, when I was walking around the forest, I saw a dog.
                    Well, I think it was a dog at the time. However, it is a wolf.
                    If you ask why I know now it is a wolf. Because I have never seen a wolf before, 
                    so I take it for granted as a dog.
                    Many years later, after the Game of Throne was broadcast for 9 years. I have seen Bai Ling
                    Many times. I realized that the "dog" I saw that day was a wolf.
